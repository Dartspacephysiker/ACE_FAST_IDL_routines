Follow-up notes on meeting with Chris

*His sense was that the data has definitely has changed
	*He was surprised at the number of discrepant events
	*When I told him I had run over some data with _every_ _single_ version of the mag cal data and that it hadn't significantly
	 affected the statistics, he was a little surprised
	*He mentioned that the electric field calibrations as well

*Ultimately, said he, we probably can't track down what exactly has changed
	*Recommends that we just go ahead and do the statistics to see what comes out

*Was gratified that we're making use of some of his old work

*Professor LaBelle spoke with him at some length about density measurements, proxies for density

*Chris said obtaining Alfvèn speeds is a rubbery business, but we might be able to screen more strongly for Alfvèn events
 by requiring higher (i.e., >10microA/m^2) currents

*Ideas for the future
	*Evidently O+ contributions to the ring current are still poorly understood (how, where, etc.)
		*He thought we might use TEAMS data to look at a few strong storms, see if we can learn anything about O+ therefrom
			*He said he had a student working on such an idea and he had a conversation with Eric Lund about using TEAMS data,
			 but he was befuddled by what Eric told him and said he ultimately moved on to other things. Evidently there was 
			 some issue teasing out what is O+, what is He, what is H+.
			*We might have to do some trickery to tease out what is quality/useful data
			*I mentioned I spoke to Eric at one point about which data are quality...
		*These are the sorts of topic that are supposedly still quite hot
	*Also mentioned that his idea is that small-scale processes are probably responsible for a good fraction of the outflow
		*I wasn't sure how this tied in with what Bin was saying, but Bin also mentioned "small-scale"...

	*Since we have some time before the FAST dataset arrives, Professor LaBelle recommended the following:
	       *We can start thinking about how to ensure reliability of ion data 
	       	   *(Eric Lund says 2D stuff only good for years one and two; this corresponds to Aug 1996 - Aug 1998 (~orbit 7900), 
       		    and probably excluding the first several months while bugs[?] got worked out)
	       *We can start thinking about how to identify storms in order to take max advantage of what data exists
