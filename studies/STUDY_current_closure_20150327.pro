; These commands were primarily generated during a meeting with Professor LaBelle and Iver Cairns, in which we were trying to understand 
;  Chris' advice in an email to me, which was as follows: 

;"With regard to the asymmetry in the number of up/down currents â€“ Perhaps see what it looks like if you evaluate Jpara*dx for each event
;and total it for each orbit where dx is the distance along the s/c trajectory mapped to a common altitude. I think this is perhaps a
;better measure of current closure than counting the filaments. A comparison of this with the average value of |jpara*dx| would perhaps
;be meaningful. If not then it could be the current sheet geometry  that screws things up which is perhaps embedded in the database
;somehow from the correlation (or lack thereof) in dbx vs dby - Seem to remember something in there on this. "
